About Me
I’m Toufique, a 3D artist and web developer with a passion for crafting virtual worlds that captivate and inspire. This portfolio is more than a collection of projects—it’s a window into my creative process, blending the artistry of 3D design with the precision of modern web development. Whether I’m sculpting interactive models or coding seamless user experiences, I’m driven by a mission to push boundaries and bring ideas to life.

What Makes This Special
3D Immersion: Dive into my projects with interactive 3D models that you can rotate, zoom, and explore from every angle.
Device-Friendly Magic: Built with responsiveness in mind, this portfolio shines on desktops, tablets, and phones alike.
Live Updates: Dynamic content loading keeps things fresh and scalable—no stale projects here!
Mood Switching: Toggle between sleek dark mode and crisp light mode to match your vibe.
Tech Stack
This project is powered by a blend of innovative tools and frameworks:

Three.js: The engine behind the 3D wizardry, bringing depth to your browser.
React.js: Fast, component-driven UI for a smooth and modern feel.
React Three Fiber: Marrying React with Three.js for declarative 3D awesomeness.
